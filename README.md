# Deep_Dive_into_Locators---Interacting_with_Element

Codes are generated using Selenium Webdriver & Java.
2 different cases were considered and tried to be mentioned in all cases.
In the Deep_Dive_into_Locators folder, there are Locators applications, which are the basis of Selenium Test Automation Framework.
After laying the foundations of the Locator concept in the Interacting_with_Element folder, test automation examples of many web elements on websites were transferred.
 
 Requirements for Programs to Run:
 - Selenium jars must be installed in the project library.
 - Since the Junit library is used in certain places, it must be added to the project library.
 - JDK must be installed on the computer and integrated into the Computer System Environment Variables, then control must be provided via the command line.
 - Since it is continued through Selenium Webdriver, browser drivers (chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver etc.) should be integrated into the project in accordance with the current browser versions.
